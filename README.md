Assignment9: 

IntTree.java includes the implemented countEmpty method that returns the number of empty branches/leaves.

JTestIntTree.java contains the unit tests for countEmpty. 
Since the Juint Test shows the functionality of IntTree.countEmpty(), no additional client class
with a main() is necessary for this version.
